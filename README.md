# Cleaned_data1

In this file, I first of all remooved all the the blank rows and then checked if there were any duplicate values which I handled.
I corrected the columns with random text with the use of the proper function.
I made the whole data set into a table and sorted them by year in ascending order.

#Cleaned_data2

In this file, I imported the txt file into my excel work sheet where I seperated the datas in columns as they were delimited.
I then corrected columns with random text format using the proper funtion.
I then included the data set to be in a table format.
